# devs_des1re

Hey there! I am devs_des1re. I live in the UK, with my parents originating from India! I am active from 4pm-8pm due to school, but on the weekends I am mostly free. I enjoy cricket, football and rugby. I take art as a hobby, and coding as a passion. Creating a 'about me' on github on is a wonderful way to express yourself. Try it out yourself!

# Experiences
I have different expriences in different areas. I have completed a 3 year Python course worth 90 hours, each year recieving a certificate. I spent some time in roblox development. I never fisnished a game sadly, so I moved a bit away from Roblox developing. At least I have 1 year experience within that area (I should really use that skills wisely xD)

# Socials
I have multiple social accounts. I am more coding than on social media, so don't expect me to respond all the time
