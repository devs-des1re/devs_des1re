# devs_des1re

Hey there! I am devs_des1re. I live in the UK, with my parents originating from India! I am active from 4pm-8pm due to school, but on the weekends I am mostly free. I enjoy cricket, football and rugby. I take art as a hobby, and coding as a passion. Creating a about me on github on is a wonderful way to express yourself. Try it out yourself!
